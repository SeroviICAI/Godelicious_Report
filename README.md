# Godelicious_Report
## Description
This is a web report about a fake supermarket chain, called Godelicious, made with Dash and Plotly (Python) and some CSS.

## How to run it
Unzip both data zip files inside the same directory as "main.py". You shall NOT modify the directory structure of this repository. After this, your directory should look like: assets, godelicious_1.csv, godelicious_2.csv, main.py and requirements.txt. Then, innstall all libraries specified in "requirements.txt" and eventually run "main.py" in "src" directory.
Note: This has been done in order to upload the same csv files that were used in this project, which were too big to be uploaded separately.
